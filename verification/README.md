How to use this verification environment: 

1. cd to the folder verification

2. type "make gen_test" to generate a random assembly test (the amount of instruction can be change in the Makefile, default: 200)

3. type "make run_spike" to run the spike simulation ⚠️**IMPORTANT: PLEASE PRESS CTRL+Z TO STOP THE SIMULATION**⚠️
   (Because we are running bare-metal Spike so there is no environment to stop the simualtion)

4. type "make clean_log" to clean up the log ⚠️**IMPORTANT: PLEASE PRESS CTRL+Z TO STOP THE SIMULATION**⚠️
   (Same reason as above)

5. now in logs/ you should see 2 logs file (spike.log and spike_ori_clean.log), spike.log is generated from Spike itself,
   spike_ori_clean.log is generated by the Python script script/clean_log.py after cleaning up the file generated from Spike
   (to reduce the storage space that the log take up due to infinite loop printing).
   We will use spike.log as the golden model log for our design, spike_ori_clean.log is just for more detail logging.

6. type "make run" to use icarus Verilog to simmulate our design, a log file name "logs/core_log.log" will contain 
   our design log

7. using Vimdiff or VScode "Select for compare/Compare with selected" function to compare "logs/core_log.log" and "logs/spike.log"
   if your core's log is the same as the golden model's log then **CONGRATS**

8. _IF were to be developed_, by running "make run" there should be a message on the terminal indicating if your core pass the test or not (using bash shell script)
